# Pancake Panic

## Project description
Welcome to Pancake Paradise, a fast-paced cooking game where you run a pancake restaurant! Your goal is to complete all customer orders before the queue overflows. Prepare pancakes, slice strawberries, add blueberries, and drizzle sauces to create the perfect dish. Each order requires precise timing and careful attention to avoid burnt pancakes. Can you keep up with the orders and become the pancake master? 

## Key features
- Pancake Cooking Mechanics: Pancakes need careful monitoring to avoid burning; ensure each pancake is cooked to a golden brown.
- Ingredient Preparation: Players slice strawberries, add blueberries, and select sauces to complete orders.
- Dynamic Order Queue: New orders appear at intervals. Failure to fulfill orders in time results in queue overflow and game over.
- Win/Loss Conditions: Complete all orders to win. Game over occurs if the queue exceeds a certain length.
